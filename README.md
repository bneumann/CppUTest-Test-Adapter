# CppUTest Test Adapter for Visual Studio Code

This is the implementation for a [CppUTest](https://cpputest.github.io/) Test Adapter for VSCode.

## Setup

To let this plugin know where your tests are set the ```cpputestExplorer.testExecutable``` to the executable of your tests. They will be executed in the ```cpputestExplorer.testExecutablePath``` path. This is currently a manual step.

If you want to use the debugging functions you will also need to setup a launch.json file with your debugger path and arguments etc. The adapter will take care of the rest. Hopefully.

### Quirks & Known issues
- Only 1 executable is supported right now
- I am a developer and I write bugs. So there must be plenty in here!
